## Description

Internet retail, also known as e-commerce, is the largest sector of the electronics industry, generating an estimated $29 trillion in 2019. E-commerce platforms like Shopify and WooCommerce provide a suite of services to businesses of all sizes. Due to their prevalence, understanding the fundamental architecture of these platforms will benefit a full-stack web developer.

### User Story

As a manager at an internet retail company
I want a back end for my e-commerce website that uses the latest technologies
so that my company can compete with other e-commerce companies

### Task

Build the back end for an e-commerce site by modifying starter code. Youâ€™ll configure a working Express.js API to use Sequelize to interact with a MySQL database.

  }
```



### Database Models

database should contain the following four models, including the requirements listed for each model:

- `Category`

  - `id`

    - Integer.

    - Doesn't allow null values.

    - Set as primary key.

    - Uses auto increment.

  - `category_name`

    - String.

    - Doesn't allow null values.

- `Product`

  - `id`

    - Integer.

    - Doesn't allow null values.

    - Set as primary key.

    - Uses auto increment.

  - `product_name`

    - String.

    - Doesn't allow null values.

  - `price`

    - Decimal.

    - Doesn't allow null values.

    - Validates that the value is a decimal.

  - `stock`

    - Integer.

    - Doesn't allow null values.

    - Set a default value of `10`.

    - Validates that the value is numeric.

  - `category_id`

    - Integer.

    - References the `Category` model's `id`.

- `Tag`

  - `id`

    - Integer.

    - Doesn't allow null values.

    - Set as primary key.

    - Uses auto increment.

  - `tag_name`

    - String.

- `ProductTag`

  - `id`

    - Integer.

    - Doesn't allow null values.

    - Set as primary key.

    - Uses auto increment.

  - `product_id`

    - Integer.

    - References the `Product` model's `id`.

  - `tag_id`

    - Integer.

    - References the `Tag` model's `id`.

 ### Classes

In Product.js initialize Product model (table) by extending off Sequelize's Model class

```
class Product extends Model {}
```

In Category.js initialize Category model (table) by extending off Sequelize's Model class

```
class Category extends Model {}
```

In ProductTag.js initialize ProductTag. model (table) by extending off Sequelize's Model class

```
class ProductTag extends Model {}

```

In Tag.js initialize Tag. model (table) by extending off Sequelize's Model class

```
class Tag extends Model {}
```

The seeds directory contains a seed for category, product, product-tag, tag, and index.js.

-- After running the

```
 npm run seeds

```

command the ecommerce_db in mysql workbench was seeded and verified on mysql workbench.


## Associations

In the index.js file of models directory the associations were created with these methods `belongsTo`, `hasMany`, `belongsToMany` were used to associate the appropriate tables

## Acceptance Criteria

- A functional Express.js API will add my database name, MySQL username, and MySQL password to an environment variable file.

- I am able to connect to a database using Sequelize

- I enter schema and seed commands

- A development database is created and is seeded with test data

- I enter the command to invoke the application and my server is started and the Sequelize models are synced to the MySQL database

- Open API GET routes in Insomnia Core for categories, products, or tags and the data for each of these routes is displayed in a formatted JSON

- Test API POST, PUT, and DELETE routes in Insomnia Core and successfully create, update, and delete data in my database

## Enforcement Responsibilities

Community leaders are responsible for clarifying and enforcing our standards of
acceptable behavior and will take appropriate and fair corrective action in
response to any behavior that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive,
or harmful.

Community leaders have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject
comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are
not aligned to this Code of Conduct, and will communicate reasons for moderation
decisions when appropriate.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within all community spaces, and also applies when
an individual is officially representing the community in public spaces.
Examples of representing our community include using an official e-mail address,
posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed
representative at an online or offline event.

## Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be
reported to the community leaders responsible for enforcement at
[![Contributor Covenant](https://img.shields.io/badge/Contributor%20Covenant-2.0-4baaaa.svg)](code_of_conduct.md).
All complaints will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly.

All community leaders are obligated to respect the privacy and security of the
reporter of any incident.

## Enforcement Guidelines

the consequences for any action they deem in violation of this Code of Conduct:

### 1. Correction

**Community Impact**: Use of inappropriate language or other behavior deemed

clarity around the nature of the violation and an explanation of why the
behavior was inappropriate. A public apology may be requested.

**Community Impact**: A violation through a single incident or series
of actions.

**Consequence**: A warning with consequences for continued behavior. No
interaction with the people involved, including unsolicited interaction with
